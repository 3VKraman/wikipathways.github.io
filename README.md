# Demo
Jekyll powered GitHub pages for GPML-Repo content

Visit site at: https://wikipathways.github.io/

## Content
Pathway content can be added as .md files to the [\_pathways](https://github.com/wikipathways/wikipathways.github.io/tree/main/_pathways) directory. The top portion of the .md file is the Jekyll Front Matter, which defines metadata used to generate the site, organize content and generate search metadata optimized for search engines.

## Development
In order to rebuild the site locally, e.g. for testing, you'll need to:
1. clone the repo
2. install Ruby, Jekyll and Bundler ([guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/))
3. run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
