value: "G protein mediated signaling pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0000125"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "G-proteins act as signal transducers between activated receptors or other incoming signals and downstream effectors.  They comprise the heterotrimeric G proteins downstream of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and the Ras superfamily of small, monomeric G proteins. They function as molecular switches alternating between the GDP-inactive and GTP-active bound state."
