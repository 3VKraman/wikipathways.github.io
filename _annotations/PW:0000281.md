definition: "The endocytic pathway allows for recycling of cargo delivered via the exocytic or secretory routes, uptake of nutrients, internalization of receptors and also, the engulfing of dying cells or of material foreign to the cell. Endocytosis can be subdivided into four pathways: clathrin-mediated  and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, micropinocytosis and phagocytosis. Endosomes and lysosomes are central endocytic components responsible for sorting,  recycling, or degradation of cargo, as necessary."
