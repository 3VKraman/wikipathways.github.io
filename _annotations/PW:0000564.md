definition: "Androgens are C19 steroids that constitutes the male sex hormones. They are also the precursors of female sex hormones, the estrogens. Testosterone and its more potent metabolite, dihydrotestosterone bind to androgen receptors to then translocate to the nucleus and activate the transcription of target genes. Many regulators, both activators and repressors, have been identified. Upregulation of receptor activity has been implicated in prostate cancer."
