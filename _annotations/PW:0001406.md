value: "SWI/SNF family mediated chromatin remodeling pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0001406"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "The SWI/SNF (switching defective/sucrose nonfermenting) family of remodelers has initially been purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In  mammals, two complexes are comprised of one of two mutually exclusive catalytic ATPase subunits along with a set of conserved core subunits and variant subunits. The SWI/SNF is involved in nucleosome sliding and ejection. Deregulation of pathway is associated with several human cancers."
