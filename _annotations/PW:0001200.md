value: "thyroid-stimulating hormone signaling pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0001200"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) signaling stimulates the secretion of thyroid hormone. Its own secretion is dependent upon activation of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in the hypothalamus by low levels of thyroid hormone (TH). TRH, TSH and TH signaling pathways are part of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis for which TH itself provides a negative regulatory loop."
level: "4"
