definition: "Those metabolic reactions involved in the synthesis of C21-steroid hormones. Pregnenolone, the first C21 steroid derived from cholesterol, and progesterone, to which pregnenolone can be converted, provide the starting material for the biosynthesis of C21, C19 and C18 steroid hormones. The C21 class includes glucocorticoids such as cortisol and mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone. Glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids are collectively referred to as corticosteroids."
