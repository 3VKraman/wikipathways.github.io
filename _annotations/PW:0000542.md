value: "AMPK signaling pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0000542"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "AMPK senses changes in cellular energy as an ATP/AMP ratio. AMP binding allosterically activates AMPK; subsequent phosphorylation events lead to repression of energy consuming pathways. One target of AMPK is the mTOR signaling pathway. AMPK activates the inhibitory Tsc2 while inhibiting the mTorc1 complex."
level: "4"
