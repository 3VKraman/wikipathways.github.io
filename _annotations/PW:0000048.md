xref-identifier: "0000048"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "Those metabolic reactions involved in the synthesis (remethylation), utilization and/or degradation of methionine, an essential amino acid for humans. The cycle produces S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet),  the major methyl donor for proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and other small molecules. The cycle also produces homocysteine (Hcy) which either regenerates methionine via the  remethylation pathway or leads to the synthesis of cysteine and derivatives via the transsulfuration pathway. Homocysteine and folate metabolic pathways are intimately related to the methionine cycle."
