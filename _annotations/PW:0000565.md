definition: "Eicosanoids, derived from omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acids, are represented by the leukotriene and prostanoid classes of which the latter is represented by several families. Some can act as endogenous ligands for members of the peroxisomal proliferator-activated nuclear receptors (PPARs). Once activated, PPARs heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and modulate the expression of target genes."
