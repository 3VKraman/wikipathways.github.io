value: "phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0000232"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway, involving PI3K class I enzymes, particularly class IA, controls various processes such as cell growth, proliferation and survival. Class IA enzymes couple to receptor tyrosine kinases or their adaptors; class IB couple to G-protein coupled receptors mainly via Galphai. The Akt family of protein kinases are activated downstream of class I PI3Ks and collectively (Akt1, 2, and 3) phosphorylate more than 70 cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates. Deregulation of the pathway has been linked to various forms of cancer."
