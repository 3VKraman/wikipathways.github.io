value: "DNA damage response pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0001360"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "The response mechanism/pathways that assure the maintenance of genomic integrity. This involves detection of DNA damage, signaling and amplification of the signal leading to activation of effectors and resulting in repair of damage, cell cycle arrest or, if necessary, cell death. Such  response mechanism/pathways may operate collectively with some of their components being shared."
