value: "peptidoglycan biosynthetic pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0000250"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "Those metabolic reactions involved in the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan - a high molecular weight polymer that forms the tough, rigid structure of bacterial cell walls. It is made up of three parts: (1) a backbone, composed of alternating N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid; (2) a set of identical tetrapeptide side-chains attached to N-acetylmuramic acid; and (3) a set of identical peptide cross-bridges. The backbone is the same in all bacterial species; however, the tetrapeptide side-chains and the peptide cross-bridges vary from species to species."
