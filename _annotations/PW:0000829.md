value: "chemokine mediated signaling pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0000829"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "Chemokine initiated pathways play important roles in the innate and adaptive immunity. They are also involved in development and tissue maintenance. The presence and localization of four cysteines is important for structural folding and is also the basis for chemokine classification. The spacing between the first two cysteine residues divides the family members into four groups. Most mammalian chemokines belong to the CC and CXC families. Chemokines signal via G-protein coupled receptors to engage distinct G protein signaling and downstream cascades."
