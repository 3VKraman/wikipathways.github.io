value: "sphingosine 1-phosphate signaling pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0000960"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a sphingolipid metabolite, can signal intracellularly as a second messenger or extracellularly as a ligand for five G protein coupled receptors. S1P pathway plays important roles in processes such as cell migration, proliferation and survival. The five receptors engage similar G proteins but their expression varies."
