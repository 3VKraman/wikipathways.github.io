value: "renin-angiotensin cascade pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0000492"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "The renin-angiotensin cascade (RAS) generates a number of bioactive peptides with diverse physiological and pathophysiological functions. RAS exerts vasoconstriction, vasodilation or vascular remodeling, cell proliferation or anti-proliferation effects, depending on which angiotensin peptide generates the signaling. Some of these features are also shared by the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS); the two systems can interact and cross-talk."
