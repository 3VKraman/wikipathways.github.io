value: "pattern recognition receptor mediated signaling pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0000925"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "Pattern recognition receptors (PRR) respond to a diverse array of exogenous molecules and also several endogenous ones. PRR's 'sensing' of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP) or damage-associated (DAMP) prompts signaling cascades leading to the expression of pro-inflammatory genes."
level: "4"
