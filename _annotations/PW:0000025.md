value: "glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0000025"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "Those metabolic reactions involved in the energy-yielding conversion of glucose to pyruvate or in the formation of glucose from non-carbohydrate precursors such as pyruvate, lactate, citric acid cycle intermediates, the carbon skeleton of many amino acids. While many enzymes are shared by the two pathways, a few steps are carried out by pathway-specific enzymes. The two pathways are independently regulated."
