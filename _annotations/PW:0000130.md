definition: "Nucleotide excision repair pathway is an important mechanism for the detection of helix distorting base alterations. Unlike the base excision repair pathway that only removes the damaged bases, the NER pathway removes an entire lesion containing segment. The single-strand gap thus introduced is filled in by DNA polymerase using the undamaged strand as a template. The pathway can be subdivided into two sub-pathways: the transcription-coupled and the global genome repair. They only differ in the lesion recognition step while the core repair component is common."
