definition: "A cell that is found in the perisinusoidal space of the liver that is capable of multiple roles including storage of retinol, presentation of antigen to T cells (including CD1d-restricted NKT cells), and upon activation, production of extracellular matrix components that can contribute to liver fibrosis. This activated state has a myofibroblast-like phenotype, though it's not clear in the literature if this is terminally differentiated. This cell type comprises approximately 8-15% of total cells in the liver.|Hepatic stellate cells are CD271-positive, desmin-positive, DDR-2-positive, GFAP-positive, synamin-positive, synaptophysin-positive, vimentin-positive, They are capable of producing angiotensin II, fibronectin, laminin, MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-11, TGF-beta1, TIMP-1, TIMP-2, type I collagen, type III collagen, type IV collagen, and type VI collagen."
