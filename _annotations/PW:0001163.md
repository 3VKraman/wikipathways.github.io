definition: "Cannabinoids are a class of rather diverse chemical compounds of which some, like endocannabinoids are naturally produced by the body in humans and other animals, while others are found in plants or are synthesized. Signaling is mediated by the cannabinoid receptors that are G protein coupled (GPCR) receptors. The endogenous cannabinoids are lipids and the signaling route is referred to as retrograde as it  travels 'backwards' from the postsynaptic to the presynaptic cell."
