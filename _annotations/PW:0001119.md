definition: "Defects in components of the citrate cycle have been shown to relate to several types of cancer. For instance, mutations in fumarate hydratase are associated with renal cancer, in succinate dehydrogenase in renal as well as paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas. Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase have also been implicated in several types of cancer. Defects in this central metabolic network result in unwanted activation of hypoxia inducible factor whose target genes are involved in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, glycolysis, among others."
