definition: "The glycolytic pathway converts the six-carbon glucose to two three-carbon pyruvate molecules. The ten reactions of glycolysis can be subdivided into an energy consuming 'stage I' and an energy generating 'stage II'. The net energy yield is two molecules of ATP. Pyruvate can further be oxidized via the citrate cycle, converted to lactose under anaerobic conditions or back to glucose via gluconeogenesis."
