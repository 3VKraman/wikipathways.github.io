value: "peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0001355"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor signaling is initiated in response to binding several compounds within classes of lipids such as the eicosanoid, leukotriene, prostagladin, among others. The receptors form heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor, bind to specific DNA elements and regulate the expression of target genes. Deregulation of the pathway has been implicated in several conditions."
