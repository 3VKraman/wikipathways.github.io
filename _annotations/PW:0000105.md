value: "Rho/Rac/Cdc42 mediated signaling pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0000105"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "Members of the Ras related Rho family of proteins control diverse processes such as actin cytoskeletal rearrangements, morphogenesis of dendritic spines, gene expression. Of note is the fact that cytoskeletal rearrangements, primarily actin remodeling have a role to play in vesicular trafficking, a process regulated by Rab proteins."
