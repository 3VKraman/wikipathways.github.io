definition: "Basket cells are inhibitory GABAergic interneurons of the brain. In general, dendrites of basket cells are free branching and contain smooth spines. Axons are highly branched. The branched axonal arborizations give rise to basket-like structures that surround the soma of the target cell. Basket cells form axo-somatic synapses, meaning their synapses target somas of other cells."
