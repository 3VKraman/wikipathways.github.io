definition: "Pyramidal neurons have a pyramid-shaped soma with a single axon, a large apical dendrite and multiple basal dendrites. The apex and an apical dendrite typically point toward the pial surface and other dendrites and an axon emerging from the base. The axons may have local collaterals but also project outside their region. Pyramidal neurons are found in the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, and the amygdala."
