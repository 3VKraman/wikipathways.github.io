definition: "The family of fibroblast growth factors (FGF) comprises 22 ligands classified into seven phylogenetic subfamilies and three groups by mode of action: the intracellular intracrine and the extracellular paracrine or canonical and endocrine or hormone-like groups. The paracrine subfamilies signal via the fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR), receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK). The endocrine subfamily is FGFR-dependent but the affinity towards the receptors is low and it relies on the Klotho family of transmembrane proteins. The intracrine subfamily is FGFR-independent. Overall, the pathway plays important roles during embryonic and postnatal development, neuromodulation, mineral metabolism and homeostasis. Deregulation of the pathway has been associated with neoplastic and metabolic diseases."
