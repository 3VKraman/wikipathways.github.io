value: "methionine degradation pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0001302"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "Those metabolic reactions involved in the degradation of methionine. In higher organisms methionine is either recycled via the remethylation pathways or is converted to cysteine via the transsulfuration pathway of homocysteine metabolism. In fungi, plants and bacteria, methionine can be processed to compounds such as methionol and/or 2-oxobutanoate."
