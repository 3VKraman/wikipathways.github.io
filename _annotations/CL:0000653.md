definition: "A glomerular visceral epithelial cell is a specialized kidney epithelial cell that contains "feet" that interdigitate with the "feet" of other glomerular epithelial cells.|GO has podocyte as a related synonym due to concern this may refer to more than one cell type. However, this did not turn up in my search. If podocyte does refer to more than one cell type, then we should classify the synonym to 'related'[tfm]."
