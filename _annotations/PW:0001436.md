value: "carbon nanotube response pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0001436"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "A pathway triggered by exposure to carbon nanotube (CNT), an allotrope of carbon of the fullerene structural family. CNTs have a very broad range of applications but can also exert toxic effects. Pulmonary toxicity possibly via reactive oxygen species, inhibition of potassium channels and DNA repair are some of the potential mechanisms of CNT genotoxicity. Various forms of cell death and inflammatory responses are triggered in response to CNT."
