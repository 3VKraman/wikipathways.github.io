value: "tyrosine-specific protein kinase mediated signaling pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0001195"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "The non-receptor tyrosine-specific kinases are represented by members of Src, Jak, Syk  and other families. Some, such as Jak, function as initiators of  intracellular pathways, others are components of several pathways. Tyrosine-specific kinases are also represented by receptor tyrosine kinases activated by growth factors and hormones.  These kinases are components of the pathways the specific growth factors and hormones initiate."
