definition: "The Ras superfamily consists of a diverse group of small, monomeric G proteins that function as molecular switches alternating between the GDP-inactive and the GTP-active bound state. The GTP-bound form can interact with many downstream effectors. Ras superfamily controls a broad spectrum of processes; deregulation of Ras cascades has been linked to several forms of cancer. The superfamily is structurally classified in five families.|Numerous articles contributed to this definition, too many to cite independently."
