definition: "Breast cancer or neoplasm is the most common cancer among women and the second worldwide after lung cancer. Deregulated pathways such estrogen or PI3K-Akt signaling have been implicated in breast cancer. In many cases, the disease is estrogen-dependent and it is possible that dysregulation of miRNA may correlate with the expression of estrogen receptor. Mutations in a number of other genes such as Brca1, 2 and 3 or p53 have also been associated with breast cancer."
