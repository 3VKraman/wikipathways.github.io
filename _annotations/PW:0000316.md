value: "calcium/calmodulin dependent kinases pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0000316"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "The multifunctional calcium/calmodulin dependent serine/threonine kinases (CAMKs) play important regulatory roles in the cardiac, muscle, nervous and immune tissues. They are represented by CAMK2 whose Ca2+/CaM binding leads to autophosphorylation and activation and the CAMK cascades that depend on an upstream CAMK kinase (CAMKK) for phosphorylation of an 'activation loop' and subsequent activation. CAMK1 and CAMK4 are the two CAMK signaling cascades."
