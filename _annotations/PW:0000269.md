definition: "Those reactions and molecular interactions underlying the folding of a protein into its functional three-dimensional structure. Folding takes place in the cytoplasm and, in the case of secreted proteins, in the endoplasmic reticulum. Proteins are checked (quality control) for proper folding and misfolded proteins are targeted for degradation."
