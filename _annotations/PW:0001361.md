definition: "The ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) serine/threonine kinase mediated signaling plays a major role in the response to DNA double strand breaks (DSB). Following lesion sensing by the MRN complex, ATM gets activated. Active ATM phosphorylates itself and targets resulting in triggering of  DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoint and signaling pathways. While ATM signaling is best documented for its role in DSB responses, evidence accumulates that it functions in a range of other, DNA damage unrelated, responses."
