value: "insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0000238"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "Insulin-like growth factor signaling plays important roles in cell growth and proliferation. Produced primarily by the liver in response to stimulation by growth hormone (GH) , the proteins activate cognate receptors to prompt intracellular signaling pathways and cell growth in a variety of tissues. Deregulation of the pathway has been associated with various conditions, including cancer."
