value: "G protein mediated signaling pathway via Galphas family"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0000227"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "Based on sequence similarity, the Galpha genes have been grouped into four classes. Exchange of GDP to GTP promoted through binding to receptors dissociates the heterotrimeric Galpa/beta/gamma complex. GTP-bound Galpha can then interact with downstream effectors. Lipid modification of Galpha regulates membrane localization and interactions with specific effectors."
