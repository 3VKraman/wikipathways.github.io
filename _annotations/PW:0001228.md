definition: "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs that target the angiotensin converting enzyme ACE. In the renin-angiotensin cascade, several bioactive peptides are derived from the precursor angiotensinogen. ACE converts angiotensin I to the potent angiotensin II. The various ACE inhibitors are grouped based on their molecular structure, the dicarboxylate-containing agents represent the largest group. Genetic variations can result in changes in drug availability and can cause differences in the response of the organism to the drug."
