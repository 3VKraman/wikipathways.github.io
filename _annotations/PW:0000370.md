value: "aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0000370"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a transcription factor whose ligands include a variety of aromatic hydrocarbons and which regulates the expression of phase I and phase II drug- and xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. Phase I enzymes convert otherwise inactive hydrocarbons into active metabolites with potential carcinogenic effects, thus rendering AhR a player in tumor initiation."
level: "4"
