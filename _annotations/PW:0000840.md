value: "protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0000840"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "Protein kinase C constitutes a family of serine/threonine kinases activated by diacylglycerol (DAG) and calcium whose signal transduction plays important roles in many cellular processes. Ligand activated G protein-coupled receptors, via Galphaq pathway, stimulate phospholipase C which cleaves PIP2 into DAG and IP3. IP3 promotes calcium release."
level: "4"
