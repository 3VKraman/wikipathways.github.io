xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "The pathway of ribosome biogenesis starts with the transcription of rRNA precursors, involves the co-transciptional events of pre-rRNA processing and the assembly of pre-ribosomal particles. The maturation of pre-40S and pre-60S particles follows independent routes.  Once in the cytoplasm, additional steps yield the mature, translation competent, ribosome. Alterations in the pathway result in specific phenotypes collectively known as ribosomopathies."
