value: "Inhibitor of DNA binding signaling pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0001372"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "The inhibitor of DNA binding (ID) family belongs to the basic helix-loop-helix superfamily of transcription factor that regulate cell growth and differentiation. They lack the DNA binding domain and exert their gene expression regulatory function through the interaction with other transcription factors. They also appear to play a role in malignant biology; in neural cancers, deregulated activity has been associated with tumor progression."
