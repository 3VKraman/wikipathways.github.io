definition: "Dopamine signaling plays important roles in processes such as motivation, learning and movement. It also plays several roles in the periphery as a modulator of renal, cardiovascular and the endocrine systems. Dopamine signals to a family of at least 5 receptors that are classified into two subfamilies that couple to distinct G proteins to elicit diverse downstream events. Deregulation of the pathway has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders."
