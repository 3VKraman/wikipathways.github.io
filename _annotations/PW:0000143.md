xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "Insulin, the peptide hormone, secreted by the pancreatic beta cells, plays essential roles in glucose and energy homeostasis. Insulin signaling activates two main intracellular pathways to regulate carbohydrate and fat metabolism and to prompt glucose absorption in insulin sensitive tissues such as skeletal muscle and adipocytes. Deregulation of the pathway has been associated with a number of conditions, primarily diabetes."
