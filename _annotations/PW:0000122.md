definition: "The Hedgehog signaling pathway (Hh) plays important roles in vertebrate embryogenesis, particularly in the differentiation of the neural tube, in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Post-embryonically it is believed to play a homeostatic role in the maintenance of stem cells. Alteration of the pathway has been implicated in a number of human cancers."
