value: "FasL mediated signaling pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0000681"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "Fas ligand binding to its receptor triggers a conformational change that allows the receptor to assemble a signaling complex known as DISC, followed by recruitment of pro-caspase-8 and activation of caspase-3 and -7. It is believed that Fas mediated signaling to elicit apoptosis follows two routes."
level: "4"
