definition: "Those metabolic reactions involved in the synthesis, utilization and/or degradation of isoprenoids or terpenoids - a large class of organic biomolecules. Isoprenoids are precursors of sterols such as cholesterol and its derivative and also of non-sterols molecules many of which are used in the post-translational modification of proteins. Plant isoprenoids are among the most commonly found and have a broad range of uses and applications in plants and beyond."
