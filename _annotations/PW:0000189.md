xref-identifier: "0000189"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "Folate mediated one-carbon metabolism represents the one-carbon transfer reactions important for de novo purine and thymidylate biosynthesis and for the remethylation of methionine in the methionine cycle and homocysteine metabolism. The methionine cycle also produces the major methyl donor for proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and other small molecules. The folate mediated one-carbon transfer and the folate cycle pathways are part of folate metabolism."
