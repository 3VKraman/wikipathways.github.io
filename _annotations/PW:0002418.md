definition: "Reversible phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol at the 3, 4, and/or 5 position of the inositol ring with one or more phosphate groups by the action of phosphatidylinositol kinases and phosphatases gives rise to several different phosphoinositides (PIs) whose various distribution is important to cellular membrane identity. PIs are involved in various transport and trafficking, signaling and metabolic pathways. As such, alteration of PIs metabolism is implicated in a wide range of human diseases."
