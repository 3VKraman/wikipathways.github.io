value: "transforming growth factor-beta superfamily mediated signaling pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0000329"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "The TGF-beta superfamily of growth factors regulates a broad spectrum of processes such as angiogenesis, embryonic development, cell differentiation, proliferation, wound healing. Binding to two types of serine/threonine receptors and activation of Smad proteins is a common theme. However, ligand-receptor interaction and the identity of the activated Smad protein(s) appear to be member specific."
