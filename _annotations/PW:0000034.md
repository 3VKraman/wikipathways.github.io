definition: "Those metabolic reactions thereby the electrons derived from the oxidation of glucose and lipids or the degradation of amino acids, are passed to oxygen via a series of series of spatially separated complexes. The energy derived generates an electrochemical gradient that drives the synthesis of ATP. The coupling between the electron transport chain, also known as the respiratory chain and the ATP biosynthetic pathway is known as oxidative phosphorylation. Under certain circumstances the two may be uncoupled."
