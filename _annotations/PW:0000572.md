xref-identifier: "0000572"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway plays important roles in the growth, differentiation and survival of neurons, particularly the striatal neurons. BDNF signals via the tropomyosin-related kinase receptor type B (TrkB) to activate PKC, PI3K-AKT and MAPK/ERK intracellular pathways. Impaired BDNF signaling contributes to the pathogenesis of conditions such as Huntington Disease (HD) and psychiatric disorders. Upregulation on the other hand, is associated with several malignancies."
