value: "RNA polymerase II transcription initiation pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0001274"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "RNA polymerase II and a set of general and specific transcription factors assemble as a large pre-initiation complex which undergoes a series of transformations before transcription proceeds. Promoter recognition and subsequent initiation of transcription are dependent upon the presence of these transcription factors. Activators and repressors impact upon transcription at these early stages."
level: "4"
