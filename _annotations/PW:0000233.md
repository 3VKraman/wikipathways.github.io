value: "tumor necrosis factor mediated signaling pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0000233"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "Tumor necrosis factor (Tnf) signaling plays pivotal roles in immunity, cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis by activating several pathways. NF-kB is a major pathway activated by Tnf; others include JNK and P38 MAPK. Through receptor associated adapters Tnf elicits apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway. Deregulation of Tnf signaling has been implicated in a great number of human diseases - cerebral malaria, cancer, multiple sclerosis, are a few examples."
