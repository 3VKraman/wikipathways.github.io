definition: "A central nervous system macrophage found in the parenchyma of the central nervous system. Marker include CD11b-positive, F4/80-positive, and CD68-positive.|Markers: Mouse: CD11b+, F4/80+, CD68+. They represent ~12% of the cells in the CNS, but they are not uniformly distributed within the CNS. A normal adult mouse brain has approximately 3.5x10e6 microglia.
