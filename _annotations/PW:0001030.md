definition: "Prolonged use of cocaine results in cardiovascular and brain damage. Cocaine is thought to bind to the dopamine reuptake transporter thus blocking the reuptake of dopamine into nerve terminals. The resulting higher concentration of dopamine in synapses leads to overactivation of dopamine receptors such as D1 and of signaling pathways downstream of it overall believed to be critical in mediating the behavioral responses to cocaine."
