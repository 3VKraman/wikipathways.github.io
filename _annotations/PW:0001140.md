value: "calcium/calcium-mediated signaling pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0001140"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "Calcium signaling impacts on a large and diverse spectrum of cellular processes such as gene expression and cell death, proliferation, muscle contraction and energy metabolism, learning, memory and synaptic plasticity. Calcium acts in signal transduction as a first as well as a second messenger. Calcium transport, which controls and maintains the calcium gradient, and calcium signaling, which the gradient promotes, are inextricably connected in the fabric of calcium homeostasis."
