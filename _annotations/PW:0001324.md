definition: "Aminoacyl-tRNA, or transfer RNA (tRNA) carries amino acids to ribosomes and is part of the translation pathway. tRNAs are specific for the amino acids with which they are associated. Their synthesis involves adenylation of the amino acid followed by its transfer; both steps require ATP. there are 22 tRNA genes encoded by the mitochondrial genome. Mutations in these genes have been implicated in a number of disorders and may affect various steps of tRNA biosynthesis."
