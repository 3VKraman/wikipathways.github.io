value: "deoxyribonucleotide metabolic pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0000875"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "Deoxyribonucleotide synthesis occurs via the de novo pathway mediated by ribonucleotide reductase or via the salvage pathway. The de novo pathway is responsible for the bulk of dNTP during the S phase of cell cycle whereas the salvage pathway mostly operates in the quiescent state of the cell. Several cytosolic and mitochondrial enzymes are responsible for the initial steps of the salvage pathway in the two compartments and for the reverse reactions that control the size of the dNTP pool."
