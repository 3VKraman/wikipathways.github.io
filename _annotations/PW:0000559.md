value: "hexosamine biosynthetic pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0000559"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "The formation of nucleotide hexosamines, primarily UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, constitutes the final step in the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway which provides substrates for the O-linked glycosylation of proteins. Glycoproteins that are either secreted from the cell or inserted into the plasma membrane undergo N-linked glycosylation. The O-linked glycosylation of nuclear and/or cytosolic proteins confers a signaling dimension to the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway."
