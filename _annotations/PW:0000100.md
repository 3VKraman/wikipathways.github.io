definition: "The pathways governing and/or regulating DNA transcription and gene expression. DNA transcription into coding and non-coding RNA is accomplished by one prokaryotic and several eukaryotic RNA polymerases. Transcription-coupled repair handles DNA lesions that interfere with the progression of RNA polymerases. Splicing of nascent RNA is thought to be predominantly co-transcriptional. Signaling pathways mediated by various transcription factors are involved in the regulation of gene expression."
