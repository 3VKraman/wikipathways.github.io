value: "metabolic pathway of cofactors and vitamins"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0000135"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "Those reactions involved in the synthesis, utilization and/or degradation of cofactors, vitamins and other nutrients. Cofactors are necessary for the proper function of certain proteins and enzymes; they can be inorganic such as the metal ions or the iron-sulfur cluster or organic. Organic compounds that are tightly bound to proteins are also referred to as prosthetic groups. Often, they are or are made from vitamins, compounds that are vital but in small amounts and which are insufficiently synthesized by the organism. Some of these molecules can also perform signaling functions."
