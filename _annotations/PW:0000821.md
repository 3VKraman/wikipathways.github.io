definition: "T cell receptor (TCR) signaling in developing thymocytes is important for the establishment of CD4 and CD8 lineages. Mature T cells express either CD4 or CD8 co-receptors which are essential for the interaction with peptide-bound class II or class I MHC complexes to elicit CD4 T helper (Th) or CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, respectively. In either case, T cell-initiated signaling activates the expression of genes whose products mediate these responses."
