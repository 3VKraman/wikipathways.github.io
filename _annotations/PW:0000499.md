definition: "NF-kB signaling plays an essential role in the mammalian immune system. The classical/canonical pathway, downstream but not exclusively of tumor necrosis factor/receptor 1 signaling, is regarded as a paradigm of NF-kB signaling. The classical and the non-classical pathway downstream of a subset of Tnf receptor superfamily, share similar sets of core components, albeit in distinct ways. Collectively they regulate the expression of a vast array of genes."
