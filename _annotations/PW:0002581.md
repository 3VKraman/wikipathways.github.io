value: "nicotinamide adenine nucleotide utilization pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0002581"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "Those metabolic reactions involved in the utilization of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). NAD, in addition to its well known role as a cofactor in redox reactions, also serves as a substrate for several classes of enzymes. These include the sirtuin deacetylases, the adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose transferases/poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases, and the cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) synthases."
