value: "endoplasmic reticulum stress  - the unfolded protein response pathway"
type: "Pathway Ontology"
xref-identifier: "0000379"
xref-dataSource: "PW"
definition: "Inhibition of protein folding or its disruption by mutant proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum triggers a signal transduction response known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR increases the biosynthetic capacity while decreasing the biosynthetic burden of the secretory pathway through up- and downregulation of gene expression."
level: "Level 3"
