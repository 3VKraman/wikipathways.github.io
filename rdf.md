<h1>The WikiPathways Semantic Web Portal</h1>

This portal describes the Semantic Web features of the WikiPathways databases, such as the
Resource Description Framework (RDF) translation, the ontology, and the new nanopublications.

The WikiPathways RDF is provided as part of the monthly releases and contains the _Curated_ and
_Reactome_ pathways. The RDF is split in two parts, the GPMLRDF part which contains a direct
translation of the content in the GPML files, and a WPRDF part which contains the biology
represented in the GPML

<h2>The WikiPathways Vocabularies</h2>

The [WikiPathways vocabularies](http://vocabularies.wikipathways.org/) are for the semantic
information about the pathway, data nodes, and interactions and the GPML vocabulary is for
the graphical information about how the pathway diagram is laid out and represented.

<h2>How to cite</h2>

If you use the RDF, vocabularies, or nanopublication, please cite the following paper:

<h2>Snorql Interface</h2>

Visit our new Snorql interface at [sparql.wikipathways.org](https://sparql.wikipathways.org).
The image below explains which steps you can take:

1: Select a query from the list
2: Press the green query button to execute your selected query
3: View the results on the same page
4: You can select your own list of example queries from github, by adding the link.
