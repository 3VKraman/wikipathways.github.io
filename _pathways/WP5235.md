description: 'Porto-sinusoidal vascular disease (PSVD) is a rare disease (Schouten
  et al., 2015), affecting less than 1 in 2000 citizens (European standard) (Griffon
  et al., 2016). It is characterized by signs of presinusoidal portal hypertension
  without cirrhosis, where the cause of the hypertension is unknown (Lee et al., 2016;
  Schouten et al., 2011). Based on that what is known about the etiology of PSVD,
  its development can be categorized into five groups: immunological disorders, chronic
  infections, exposure to medications or toxins, prothrombic conditions, and genetic
  predisposition (Schouten et al., 2015). In practice, the disease has multiple contributing
  factors (Siramolpiwat et al., 2016).   This pathway describes a mutation in the
  KCNN3 gene that is hypothesized to result in genetic predisposition to PSVD (Koot
  et al., 2016). PSVD has also been referred as idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension
  (INCPH), hepatoportal sclerosis, incomplete septal cirrhosis, obliterative portal
  venopathy, partial nodular transformation, non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis, nodular
  regenerative hyperplasia (NRH), and idiopathic portal hypertension (Schouten et
  al., 2015; Siramolpiwat et al., 2016; Besmond et al., 2017).'
