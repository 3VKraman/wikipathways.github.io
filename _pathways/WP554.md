title: "ACE inhibitor pathway"

description: "The core of this pathway was elucidated over a century ago and involves the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (Ang I) by renin, its subsequent conversion to angiotensin II (Ang II) by angiotensin converting enzyme. Ang II activates the angiotensin II receptor type 1 to induce aldosterone synthesis, increasing water and salt resorption and potassium excretion in the kidney and increasing blood pressure."
