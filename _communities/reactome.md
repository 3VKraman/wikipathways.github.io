title: "Welcome to the Reactome Community at WikiPathways"
description: "The Reactome page at WikiPathways maintains pathway content periodically synced with the Reactome collection. Reactome is an open-source, open access, manually curated and peer-reviewed pathway database. Pathway annotations are authored by expert biologists, in collaboration with Reactome editorial staff. The rationale behind Reactome is to convey the rich information in the visual representations of biological pathways familiar from textbooks and articles in a detailed, computationally accessible format. The core unit of the Reactome data model is the reaction. Entities (nucleic acids, proteins, complexes and small molecules) participating in reactions form causal chain of events or pathways.


In collaboration with WikiPathways, we have established a custom pathway data exchange pipeline. Reactome pathways are now incorporated into WikiPathways, an open, collaborative platform dedicated to the curation of biological pathways. We encourage you to edit, curate and create pathway content here. The Reactome team will periodically assess and selectively incorporate changes back into our centralized collection.

An open source format converter has been developed that converts Reactome pathways to the GPML format. The converter is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wikipathways/reactome2gpml-converter)."
