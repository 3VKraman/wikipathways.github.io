contribute: "We are helping to coordinate an international effort to build and curate pathway models relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic. If you find or add a pathway at WikiPathways that should be included in this collection, please let us know by contacting Martina Kutmon (mkutmon[AT]gmail.com). Resources to get started:

* [Growing collection of COVID-19 pathways](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Portal:Disease/COVIDPathways)

* [Published pathway figures related to COVID-19](https://gladstone-bioinformatics.shinyapps.io/shiny-covidpathways/)

* [Protein sequence alignments of SARS-CoV-2](https://alexanderpico.github.io/SARS-CoV-2_Alignments/)

* [COVID-19 disease map initiative](https://covid.pages.uni.lu/map_curation): a broader community of pathway curators working with WikiPathways, Pathway Commons, Reactome, Cell Designer and more.

* [Human Coronavirus protein identifiers](https://egonw.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-Queries/sparql/virusProteinsAll.code.html) and [SARS-CoV-2 protein identifiers](https://egonw.github.io/SARS-CoV-2-Queries/sparql/virusProteins.code.html)
