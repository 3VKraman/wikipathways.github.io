description: "This page highlights WikiPathways content related to rare genetic human diseases, and is designed as a central organizing point for exploring, curating and expanding the collection of rare disease pathways. A rare or orphan disease is a disease which affects relatively few people. The exact definition varies between 1:1000 and 1:200.000. E.g. it can be 1:1500 (USA) , 1:2000 (EU) or 1:2500 (Japan). Rare diseases are mostly caused by genetic variation making them chronic and hard to cure. The severity depends on the affected gene and its physiological implications."
