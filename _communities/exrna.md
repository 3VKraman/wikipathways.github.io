description: "The [Common Fund strategic planning process](http://commonfund.nih.gov/planningactivities/overview-planning) has developed a program on [Extracellular RNA Communication](http://exrna.org/). This program aims to discover fundamental biological principles about the mechanisms of exRNA generation, secretion, and transport; to identify and develop a catalog of exRNA found in normal human body fluids; and to investigate the potential for using exRNAs in the clinic as therapeutic molecules or biomarkers of disease. To find out more about the program, visit [exrna.org](http://exrna.org/)."

"This community fouses on curating the molecular mechanisms of COVID-19. It is part of a larger community effort called the [COVID-19 Disease Map](https://covid.pages.uni.lu/). After an initial comment in 2020 in Scientific Data [Ostaszewski, et al.](http://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-0477-8), a longer paper from the whole community was published in 2021 in Molecular Systems Biology: [Ostaszewski, et al.](https://doi.org/10.15252/msb.202110387). More recently, the community is working on a paper focused on different analysis and modelling approaches using the COVID-19 Disease Map, currently available on bioXriv [Niarakis, et al.](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.17.520865)"
