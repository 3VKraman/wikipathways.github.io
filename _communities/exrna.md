description: "The [Common Fund strategic planning process](http://commonfund.nih.gov/planningactivities/overview-planning) has developed a program on [Extracellular RNA Communication](http://exrna.org/). This program aims to discover fundamental biological principles about the mechanisms of exRNA generation, secretion, and transport; to identify and develop a catalog of exRNA found in normal human body fluids; and to investigate the potential for using exRNAs in the clinic as therapeutic molecules or biomarkers of disease. To find out more about the program, visit [exrna.org](http://exrna.org/)."
