description: "This page is set up to give an overview of all Inherited Metabolic Disorders (IMDs, also known as Inborn Errors of Metabolism (IEM). This pathway collection also featured in the latest [NAR Database Issue on WikiPathways](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa1024). **IMPORTANT**: the current list of pathways is based on the currently published (2014) 4th edition of the book ([ISBN 3642403360](https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Special:BookSources/3642403360) (978-3642403361)). There is a new edition upcoming and the pathways in the new edition are being digitized in a collaboration with the chapter authors, but these have no been made public yet, and therefore do not show up here.
